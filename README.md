# DirectToMongoProductSaver

Mass product saver using a direct to database approach to speed product saving.

Must be used as dependency in 1.4 projects when using MongoDB storage.

We'll integrate this behavior by default in the 1.5 and we'll depreciate this bundle.

When using this bundle, the http://docs.akeneo.com/latest/cookbook/import_export/mongodb-fast-writer.html is not required anymore, it will be deprecated in 1.5.
